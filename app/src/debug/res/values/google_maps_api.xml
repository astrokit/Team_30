    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=3B:33:00:A0:A5:35:89:EA:C7:AB:B4:FB:B9:3D:42:E8:11:D7:89:CF%3Bat.team30.setroute.ui

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    at.team30.setroute.ui

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    3B:33:00:A0:A5:35:89:EA:C7:AB:B4:FB:B9:3D:42:E8:11:D7:89:CF

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
